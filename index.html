                        The alphabet. Feels logical to memorize the Japanese alphabet before anything.
                        Dragged out the dusty Anki which incredibly still had my previous settings saved. Painfully reminding me of the last time
                        I dropped this for a prolonged period of time.

                        I am still in the extreme bare bones of the actual design of the blog. Even if I purposely wanted it to be minimalist I am not at the 
                        jaded 55 year old math teacher's university page level of bare bones just yet. 
                        I am essentially living in the house that I am simultaneously building.

                        I like Japan. I want to learn Japanese. It hurts to say that I've wanted to learn Japanese for more than a decade at this point.
                        Imagine if I studied at least 30 min every day for the past decade I'd be close to achieving Japanese proficiency, at least according to the 
                        <a href="https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/" target="_blank">US&nbspGovernment.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal with this blog is to document my process of unraveling the behemoth that is the Japanese language.
                        Hopefully with the added result of also untangling my own philosophy and methods surrounding learning and motivation. Additionally, I found a weird reassurance in it also being
                        a dumping ground for tiny programming projects that doesn't deserve its own repository. I envision these small projects
                        being mixed with Japanese, trying to make it my own. Finding <strong>value</strong>. Finding relevance in work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Procrastination Equation. This fantastic and maybe more mathematical representation of the main factors that make up our motivation is proposed 
                        in the book of the same name by Dr Piers Steel. In a vague attempt to not gross myself with conceited preaching I will try to just stick with explaining how it applied 
                        to me which in turn influenced me to create this blog. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>Motivation = (Expectancy * Value) / (Impulsiveness * Delay)</i> is the equation. As always, frustratingly, the answers feel obvious
                        but oh so hard to arrive at. <strong>Value</strong> in this case is that the blog needs to be connected to my wants and goals. Being... that I want to learn Japanese
                        and code meaningful programs. Huh, simple right? Yeah well making that answer corporeal to me rather than some ethereal feeling still took a decade.
                        <strong>Expectancy</strong> in the equation is striking a balance of confidence in my abilities. Visualize having a full conversation in Japanese, man it'd be cool, but keep it tangible. What can I expect? Keep it realistic,
                        this is a massive journey but not impossible. Pay attention to small incremental improvements, much easier if its documented.
                        Looking back on things that I've learned can create a spiral of confidence. "I accomplished this here." equating to "I can do this!"
                        Minimize <strong>Impulsiveness</strong> and <strong>Delay</strong>, two comforting devils that will ruin your life. 
                        Lowering impulsiveness made me decide on ensuring that posts can be pure HTML, no weird over-engineered framework way 
                        beyond the scope of what I'm trying to accomplish here. Imagine it like a slipstream into a motivating environment
                        and once I'm in it's much easier to punch out a few rows of code to accompany the post. Having a clear and <em>close</em> finish line spikes motivation.
                        It's so ingrained in the fibers of being human that the longer the delay the easier I can delude myself that a day's work 30 days before the deadline is not as 
                        important as a day's work 1 day before the deadline. Now imagine a goal having no deadline at all, that shit will never be done.
                        So, my attempt at lowering delay in this case is in tandem with my pre-existing challenge to <a href="https://github.com/frumsrekovni" target="_blank">commit to Git</a> every day not matter how small.
                        Even with this deadline being rather arbitrary and having full awareness that it is self-imposed it still strangely fires up that weird ingrained
                        human monkey reaction that it needs to be done. Reminding me of how 
                        <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/placebo-can-work-even-know-placebo-201607079926" target="_blank">open-label placebos have shown to work on self-observation conditions</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyway, that's my reasoning behind this project. I could go on forever about this but I need to get to the language part eventually right?
