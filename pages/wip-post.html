                        I have been reading Genki and reading children's books. Genki was made for foreign university students.
                        Is that really better? Why shouldn't I learn the exact way a Japanese child would naturally learn Japanese?

                        Listening, speaking, reading and hand-writing. Natural stuff in any study right? 
                        Obviously, obvious steps in processing a language. But what about typing on a computer keyboard?
                        Even typing out that small Japanese paragraph in basic hiragana and katakana took much longer than expected.
                        There's so many tiny things that stops you dead in your tracks like:
                        How do I jump between keyboard layouts and alphabets? How do I type out びっくり instead of びつくり? 
                        How do I type out characters like <i>?, Å, Ä, and Ö</i> when on the Japanese keyboard layout? Why is every single keyboard shortcut not working?
                        Also of course not just strictly computer related writing questions like:
                        Why is ウォ preferred over ヲ? Why has ウェcompletely erased the notion of using ヱ? Is there any difference between ぢ and じ?
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Typing basic Japanese with these questions firing in every single neuron is making me feel like a new born baby.
                        I'm now a senior citizen that types with a careful fully outstretched index finger
                        while holding an imaginary magnifying glass in the other hand. It's back to basics. All of that crusty gray brain matter
                        need to pave new paths. However don't fret Joshua, here's the deal: <br>

                    <p>
                        Å Ä Ö. tough luck, just get used to the windows key + spacebar command to jump to your regular layout for those ones.
                        The shortcuts that you are used to like CTRL-S and CTRL-Z actually do work. You just need to first jump out of that lingering
                        text suggestion box that the Japanese layout activates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No sane Japanese typer uses the CTRL-CAPSLOCK, SHIFT-CAPSLOCK and ALT-CAPSLOCK shortcuts to jump between the alphabets.
                        Everything is always typed out in hiragana. When you want a word to be in katakana just type it out fully in hiragana and then press F7.
                        Actually more often than not the suggestion box will just give it to you in katakana.
                        When you want a word to be in the latin alphabet start the word capitalized. Unless you want use <thead></thead> Swedish
                        special characters, they don't work, need to jump to your regular keyboard layout. Maybe a customizable layout would fix this?

                        When you start using kanji the enormous suggestion box becomes your lifesaver.
                        That's where all the kanji suggestions are and will hopefully down the line fool people on the internet that you are not in the first grade.
                        But it's not useful until you learn what the kanji means. There are plenty of sentences with the exact same hiragana that mean
                        vastly different things dependant on its kanji. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to type the important にゃー and double consonants you need to learn how to type small kanas. This is 
                        done by prefixing a kana with x. For double consonant double tap the first letter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        make a custom keyboard that makes latin characters work.
                        phones easily switch between languages.
                        the suggestion box can usually guess when its supposed to be katakana.
                        Typing di and du for ぢ　And　づ　Is messed up
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The answer to the nowadays obsolete katakana can essentially be summed up to modern speaking japanese being "lazy" and the miniscule existing 
                        differences they had has over the years been consumed by an already existing kana.
