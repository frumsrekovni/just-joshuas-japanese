            Kanji I have encountered more than once recently:
            私, 高, 山, 登, 願, 日, 見, 本, 人, 何, 回、少

            遅, 達 these are like the same kanji man
            Funny Kanji:
            凸, 凹, 鬱, 忘
            Forget is deceased + mind, just brilliant.

            Endings:
            (noun)-desu     :   is / to be. e.g. ジョシュアです
            (noun)-da       :   same as desu, but perceived as more self-centered, therefore less polite
            (noun)-ne       :   Seeking other's approval. (Right / Isn't it) e.g. きもちわるいTシャツですね
            (noun)-me       :   A derogatory honorific

            (noun)-jin      :   Person from (noun) e.g. スウェデンじん
            (noun/pronoun)-tachi    :   A group of that (noun/pronoun) e.g. 私たち、 船員たち、小鳥たち
            -na             :   often masculine ending that indicates emotion or emphasis
            (noun)-bu       :   A club of that noun e.g. ソフト部

            Verb Conjugations(Grouped in 3: 1:‐(w)u, ‐t(s)u, (preceded by a,u or o)-ru | 2:-ru | 3:Irregulars kuru and suru):
            (Verb)-masu     :   Past:(thing)-mashita : to do something e.g. たべます、たべました : these are the polite forms of -ru and -ta
            (Verb)-te/de    :   to make a request e.g. はなして、のんで　: Unless you want to sound like a threatening gangster the request should end with ください　if there's any sense
            of entitlement to the thing requested otherwise use おねがいします　if it's more of a favour.
            (Verb)-te + mitai: I want to e.g. ケブネカイセへいってみたいです、ケブネカイセにのぼってみたいです
            (Verb)-te + imasu: You are doing the verb now e.g. うんちしています

            Adjective Conjugations:
            (I-Adjective)-katta : My past impression is that adjective replace the -i with -katta e.g. 楽しかったです
            (NA-Adjective) deshita : My past impression is that adjective replace desu with deshita e.g. べんりでした

            Particles:
            wa, ka, kara, no

            wa(は) - topic-marker particle

            no - (noun) no (noun):   Connects nouns. e.g. てきのサノスめです

            ka - Indicates a question
            (Verb)-ka : Transforms the form to a questioning form e.g. なにをたべますか

            (Object) de (Verb)-mashita : Did the verb by the means of object e.g. パソコンでプログラミングしました。

            ni - Indicates the destination / Location / time of action　(Where you are are will be in both space and time)
            (Object) ni (Verb)-masu : Verb(ing) to the object destination e.g. このでんしゃはキルナにいきますか。Sidenote, this sentence is a classic early example of realising the usefulness of kanji,
            when I read through the sentence for the first time after a few days after writing it I read "kono densha wa Kiruna nii kimasuka" Which is more or less nonsense and makes you reread it
            until you realise it is "kono densha wa Kiruna ni ikimasuka" A beginner mistake obviously, but I am a beginner, and I made this mistake. But if I would have been familiar
            with the kanji 行 which roughly means "to go" and can be read as い this mistake is essentially impossible: このでんしゃはキルナに行きますか。

            e(へ) - indicates the direction of movement
            (destination) e  : Makes the destination where you would wish to go e.g. ケベネカイセへいってみったいです 

            made - to a destination
            (destination) made お願いします　: Makes the destination where you want to go. e.g. 家までお願いします

            (Place) ni (Subject) : Says where the subject is e.g. 家にいる

            Random observations:
            Kochira and Dochira are the polite forms of Koko and Doko.

            th sounds becomes sa in japanese. Like Thanos(サノス) and Thank you(サンキュー)

            Typing di and du for ぢ　And　づ　Is messed up

            手袋 being hand+bag for Gloves is too cute. Nothing beats the german Handschuhe meaning Hand+Shoe in terms of funnyness.
            Why is Shoes(靴) not 足袋 Foot+bag? 足袋 Is apparently those traditional two toe Tabi socks.

            有る　might aswell be the most important word to know everything about.

            動物どうぶつ　means animal, but I enjoy the observation of being a motion+thing a lot more.

            ただにジョシュアの日本語

            both　いる and ある means "be". iru is for people and living things while aru is for things. います　and あります　are the polite forms.
            (subject) wa (location) no (person/thing location) ni imasu/arimasu e.g. ジョシュアはエジプトのピラミッドの前にいます　or ハンバーガーは私の中にあります

            The plural of mountain being mountainmountain is pretty funny.

            Very common phrases from watching native Japanese speakers:
            目の前に, この感じ, こちら, 実話, 思います, あいつ, そろそろ, 今回は, これは大失敗かも、矢っ張り矢っ張、矢っ張り、全然、それば、そです、ぜひ、たくさん、中々、少し、但し、そして、あちこち、

                <h2>Obsolete Kana</h2>
                <time class="date" datetime="yyyy-mm-dd">yyyy-mm-dd</time>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        Why is ウォ preferred over ヲ? Why has ウェcompletely erased the notion of using ヱ? Is there any difference between ぢ and じ?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An oversimplified answer to the nowadays obsolete katakana in modern Japanese like ヲ and ヱ can 
                        essentially be summed up to modern speaking patterns having rid of the existing miniscule
                        vocal difference they had. These katakana been consumed by an already existing kana.
                        There's much more to it but meaningless to dwell over at my current stage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Certain kana visible on the common kana charts are not in use and turned obsolete by other kanas. ヲ comes in mind. を has
                        also lost its unique sound and more or less sounds interchangeably like お.
                        Some have even fallen so out of favour that they are not even on the charts anymore. like ゐ, ヱ and ゑ. 
                        These are interesting to maybe explore further but in the grand scheme of things meaningless if your goal is to
                        communicate with modern Japanese speakers.

                    <p>
                        Chinese and Japanese are famous for being tonal/pitch languages with how widespread its usage is and how it can change the meaning of
                        something drastically, often causing embarrassing beginner mistakes. But a very easy thing to forget is that Swedish,
                        my native language is in fact a pitch language, which has to be one of the most annoying things to learn, yet
                        I am sitting on this knowledge innately. Spaden, tomten, backen, gifter and radar are just a few examples 
                        of words where both meanings are commonly used, spelled exactly the same and only changing meaning when pitched differently during speech.

                        A way to open your third eye in your kanji study is to understand radicals and how you often times can 
                        get a solid idea of what is being written even if you can't read it.

                        And if you're lucky you can guess your way to how a kanji is read if you know
                        common reading of the radicals.

                        I am playing the Japanese version of Pokemon Platinum. It's great
                        because the language is very simple. Not a kanji in sight in the dialogue.
                        Interestingly my rival uses オレ to refer to himself. Which apparently is a common way to give off the vibe that a young boy is speaking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I notice that the game commonly uses『 to indicate who's speaking but to make that character on a keyboard you need to type out "kakko"?!
                        って　is used to indicate that you're quoting someone.
                        リィ　shows up and is this just a long ri? similar to リー
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Learning about こわいものなしフレヂィー　was definitely a highlight.
                        Interestingly しフレヂィー has ィ and a ー　almost like a super long di. Di+i+i Freddiii

                        to further conversations. Let's present some must know introductory phrases and then build the script. All phrases will have real examples.

                        <h4>挨拶</h4>
                        <a href="https://youtu.be/7AU3Rye_cCc?t=97" target="_blank">こんにちは</a>
                         and 
                         <a href="https://youtu.be/cC_xs49y-ds?t=12" target="_blank">こんばんは</a>
                          - fail-safe standard greetings used the same was as "Good day" and "Good evening". Interestingly both end with a は particle because they're
                        shorthands for 今日はご機嫌いかがですか and 今晩はご機嫌いかがですか respectively. 今日は can be read as こんにちは and literally means "This day" because of the 
                        は particle, same principle for 今晩は. But 今日は is also commonly used as it's literal translation. For example 今日は暑い but here it is not read as 
                        こんにちは but きょうは. So it's really about context, but more often than not the greetings are written out in hiragana.
                        However, 今晩は when used in its literal non-greeting way it IS read as こんばんは, like in the sentence: 今晩は予定がある.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        おはようございます - Means "Good morning". But so does 
                        <a href="https://youtu.be/8kuvxCAFYos?t=144" target="_blank">おはよう.</a>
                         ございます is keigo, context matters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        はじめまして - "Hello". For first meetings, it's also more or less literally what it translates as. Used the same as you would use "Pleased to meet you"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://youtu.be/WDbVtmGfPXs?t=41" target="_blank">よろしくお願いします</a>
                         - Extremely common phrase yet is not that obvious in it's full meaning and there is not real usage real equivalent in English.
                        Its meaning changes heavily dependant on how it's used and the literal translation is a convoluted mess.
                        In the context of greeting someone it essentially means "Nice to meet you". お願いします is keigo, context matters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://youtu.be/YnOCCzixU5w?t=145" target="_blank">久しぶり</a>
                        - Means "Long time". Used the same as you would in English. Prefixing with a formal お(お久しぶり) is not unusual when used as a greeting and 
                        does separate it a little bit from you just talking about how it was a long time since you ate shrimp or something.
                        To make it unmistakeably a overtly nice greeting 
                        you could say 大変お久しぶりですね, Turning it into the same enthusiasms and importance as someone saying something similar to
                        "Has it not been ages since I last met you" to you. Again, context matters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://youtu.be/t6O0qY6F-po?t=22" target="_blank">どうも</a>
                         - Is a duct tape of a word. Greetings, gratitude, stressing adverb etc. Many usages, and one of its usages is indeed "Hello".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        もしもし - I love moshi moshi. But this is strictly a over the phone "Hello"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        おっす、ヤッホ、よー　- now we're real casual greeting our friends. Anything goes here really.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h4>Names</h4>
                        <p>
                            私の名前はジョシュアです - "My name is Joshua". Foolproof way of giving your name but just like in English it can be perceived as rigid in most contexts, 
                            like for example someone asking your name in a social setting.
                            <a href="https://youtu.be/LF8HlVOa_h0?t=135" target="_blank">ジョシュアです</a>
                             conveys the same thing and the rest could be filled in through context, and honestly even this is longer than how it
                            often goes down for me in Sweden where my greeting is often just blankly stating my name during a handshake.
                            Here your entire toolkit with varying keigo and word choice, when and where to use them you really have to learn from observing others.
                            <a href="https://youtu.be/uxYLXaXtH9I?t=73" target="_blank">名前はジョシュアです</a>
                            
                            私はジョシュアです
                            These are more close to the vibe of saying "Call me Joshua":
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA1UNJirOTI&t=36s" target="_blank">ジョシュアと申します</a>
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMWluotEEP4&t=75s" target="_blank">ジョシュアと言います</a>
                            <a href="https://youtu.be/raZBy3CYZBc?t=38" target="_blank">ジョシュアって言います</a>
                            ジョシュアっていう
                            <a href="https://youtu.be/8ySdXN93UaA?t=126" target="_blank">ジョシュアと呼んで</a>
                            
                        </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        名前は - "What's your name". You should know about the は particle and be able to tell that this literally translates to "Name is".
                        Again, adding a formal お is common お名前は. And being very clear you could actually construct a question: お名前は何ですか
                        which is much closer to actually translating to "What's your name"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h4>Pleasantries</h4>
                        <p>
                            元気 - "How are you". It literally just means well/fit/healthy etc and just like in English saying "Good?" in a 
                            inquisitory manner works the same for 元気? or 元気だった? Actually saying it in form of a question is equally common tho: 元気ですか.
                            This can be answered with the same logic. 元気 in a non-inquisitory manner or just 元気です or 元気だった.
                            The former being more presently and the latter being more during the time since. 
                            Ending with -janai is the negative form, so 元気じゃない or 元気じゃなかった is a casual way of saying that you are in fact, not 元気.
                            Or not been 元気.
                        </p>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <h4>Gratitude</h4>
                        <a href="https://youtu.be/HsqMkDAkZXM?t=448" target="_blank">有難うございます</a> - "Thank you very much". うございま is keigo,
                        <a href="" target="_blank">有難う</a> works.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://youtu.be/TDZzafNX2oo" target="_blank">いただきます</a>
                        - "Thank you for the food". Said before eating. A very Japanese custom that is more or less
                        non-existent in my daily life in Sweden. The literal translation is of course completely different and 
                        makes the usage of this phrase a bit more nuanced. It more literally translates to simply "I receive".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://youtu.be/qUftGZwGXQg?t=432" target="_blank">ごちそうさまでした</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/HsqMkDAkZXM?t=700" target="_blank">ごちそうさまです</a>
                        - both essentially means "Thanks for the food". ごちそうさま is without keigo. This is said after finishing a meal.
                       
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://youtu.be/ctDEMnLhuto?t=575" target="_blank">どうも</a> - "Thank you". Hello and Thank you, what a useful word.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        どういたしまして - "You're Welcome". 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h4>Forgiveness</h4>
                        <a href="https://youtu.be/HsqMkDAkZXM?t=906" target="_blank">すみません</a> - "Excuse me" and "I'm sorry".
                        Reminds me of how the Swedish word "Förlåt" is similarly used in both ways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ごめんなさい - "I'm sorry". - なさい is keigo.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        申し訳ございません - "I'm very sorry" - A much more serious apology. ざいません is keigo, ありません is more casual.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        失礼いたします - "Excuse me". いたします is keigo, context matters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h4>Where from?</h4>
                        スウェーデン出身です　- "I'm from Sweden". 出身 means origin. So this more like saying "Origin is Sweden"
                        スウェーデンから来ました - "I'm from Sweden". から is an extremely common word that functions the same as "from". 来ました Is "came". so more like "came from Sweden"
                        <a href="https://youtu.be/N36-vzcLm8U?t=222" target="_blank">スウェーデンです</a> - "I'm from Sweden". My favorite and very Swedish. Literally "Swedish is" and I love it.
                        
                        <a href="https://youtu.be/8kedRIBGvoM?t=144" target="_blank">スウェーデン人です</a>
                        - "I'm Swedish". Adding 人 means person/human and can be read as -jin. So this is literally "Sweden person is" You can do this with any noun, 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokujin" target="_blank">it's very common</a>.
                        
                        Remember that "I'm" is not actually written anywhere here, that would require a 私は somewhere, but in a conversation this is understood from the context, 
                        you feel yourself what is appropriate in a given scenario.
                        出身はどこですか - "Where are you from?"
                        どこから来ましたか - "Where did you come from?"
                        <a href="https://youtu.be/N36-vzcLm8U?t=222" target="_blank">どちらから</a> - "Where did you come from?"
                        どこからきたの
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h4>Goodbye</h4>
                        さよなら - "Farewell". 
                        失礼いたします - "Good bye". Used when leaving in a work/school environment. いたします is keigo, context matters.
                    </p>

                        Ok I have my building blocks now, let's build some simple scripts. <br>
