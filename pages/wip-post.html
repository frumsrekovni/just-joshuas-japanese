                        I have been reading Genki and reading children's books. Genki was made for foreign university students.
                        Is that really better? Why shouldn't I learn the exact way a Japanese child would naturally learn Japanese?

                        Listening, reading, hand-writing and speaking, all real natural stuff in any learning really. 
                        Obviously, they are obvious steps in processing a language. But how about typing on a computer keyboard?
                        Even typing out that tiny japanese paragraph in simple hiragana and katakana took much longer than expected.
                        There's a lot of small things that stops you dead in your tracks and stumps you.
                        How do I jump between keyboard layouts and alphabets? How do I type out びっくり instead of びつくり? 
                        How do I type out characters like <i>? Å Ä Ö</i> when on the Japanese keyboard layout? Why is every single keyboard shortcut not working?
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Switching between keyboard layouts and learning all of these shortcut commands is making it feel like I'm a new born baby.
                        Never imagined that I'd devolve into the computer senior citizen that types with a careful fully outstretched index finger
                         while holding an imaginary magnifying glass in the other hand. But it's back to basics. All of that crusty gray brain matter
                        need to pave new paths. Don't be scared Joshua, essentially, here's the deal: <br>

                    <p>
                        Å Ä Ö. tough luck, just get used to the windows key + spacebar command to jump to your regular layout for those ones.
                        The real important keyboard shortcuts like CTRL-S and CTRL-Z actually do work. You just need to first jump out of that lingering
                        suggestion box that Japanese rely on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No sane Japanese typer uses the CTRL-CAPSLOCK, SHIFT-CAPSLOCK and ALT-CAPSLOCK to jump between the alphabets when you want
                        katakana, hiragana etc. Everything is always typed out in hiragana. When you want a word to be in katakana just type it out fully in hiragana and then press F7.
                        When you want a word to be in the latin alphabet start the word capitalized. Unless you want to type in Swedish
                        that use special characters, it doesn't work, need to jump to your regular keyboard layout. When you start using Kanji the enormous suggestion box transforms from annoying to life-saving.
                        That's where all the kanji suggestions are and will hopefully down the line fool people on the internet that you are not in the first grade.
                        But it's not useful until you learn what the kanji even mean. There are plenty of words with the exact same hiragana that mean
                        vastly different things dependant on its kanji. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to type the ever important にゃー and double consonants you need to learn how to type small kanas. This is 
                        done by prefixing a kana with <em>x</em> or for double consonant double tap the first letter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        make a custom keyboard that makes latin characters work.
                        phones easily switch between languages.
                        the suggestion box can usually guess when its supposed to be katakana.
                        Typing di and du for ぢ　And　づ　Is messed up
