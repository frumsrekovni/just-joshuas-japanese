            Kanji I have encountered more than once recently:
            私, 高, 山, 登, 願, 日, 見, 本, 人, 何
            遅, 達 these are like the same kanji man
            Funny Kanji:
            凸, 凹, 鬱

            (noun)-desu     :   is / to be. e.g. ジョシュアです
            (noun)-me       :   A derogatory honorific
            (noun) no (noun):   Connects nouns. e.g. てきのサノスめです
            (verb)-tai      :   Express desire. e.g. たべたい   : Express desire for nouns ほしい　is used　e.g. ほんがほしいです. Can also be used for verbs. てつだってほしいです

            Verb Conjugations(Grouped in 3: 1:‐(w)u, ‐t(s)u, (preceded by a,u or o)-ru | 2:-ru | 3:Irregulars kuru and suru):
            (Verb)-masu    : Past:(thing)-mashita : to do something e.g. たべます、たべました : these are the polite forms of -ru and -ta
            (Verb)-te/de   : to make a request e.g. はなして、のんで　: Unless you want to sound like a threatening gangster the request should end with ください　if there's any sense
            of entitlement to the thing requested otherwise use おねがいします　if it's more of a favour.

            Particles:
            wa, ka, kara

            ka - Indicates a question
            (Verk)-ka : Transforms the form to a questioning form e.g. なにをたべますか

            de - Indicates the means.
            (Object) de (Verb)-mashita : Did the verb by the means of object e.g. パソコンでプログラミングしました。

            ni - Indicates the destination / Location / time of action　(Where you are are will be in both space and time)
            (Object) ni (Verb)-masu : Verb(ing) to the object destination e.g. このでんしゃはキルナにいきますか。Sidenote, this sentence is a classic early example of realising the usefulness of kanji,
            when I read through the sentence for the first time after a few days after writing it I read "kono densha wa Kiruna nii kimasuka" Which is more or less nonsense and makes you reread it
            until you realise it is "kono densha wa Kiruna ni ikimasuka" A beginner mistake obviously, but I am a beginner, and I made this mistake. But if I would have been familiar
            with the kanji 行 which roughly means "to go" and can be read as い this mistake is essentially impossible: このでんしゃはキルナに行きますか。

            (Place) ni (Subject) : Says where the subject is e.g. 家にいる

            th sounds becomes sa in japanese. Like Thanos(サノス) and Thank you(サンキュー)

            Typing di and du for ぢ　And　づ　Is messed up

            Very common phrases from watching native Japanese speakers:
            目の前に, この感じ, こちら, 実話, 思います, あいつ, そろそろ, 今回は, これは大失敗かも、矢っ張り矢っ張、矢っ張り、全然


            &nbsp   : Non-breakable space
            &#8209  : Non-breakable hyphen

                <h2>Obsolete Kana</h2>

                    <p>
                        Certain kana visible on the common kana charts are not in use and turned obsolete by other kanas. ヲ comes in minde. を has
                        also lost its unique sound and more or less sounds interchangeably like お.
                        Some have even fallen so out of favour that they are not even on the charts anymore. like ゐ, ヱ and ゑ. 
                        These are interesting to maybe explore further but in the grand scheme of things meaningless if your goal is to
                        communicate with modern Japanese speakers.

                        日本語(にほんご)を練習(れんしゅう)しています。

                        Listening, speaking, reading and hand-writing. Natural stuff in any study right? 
                        Obviously, obvious steps in processing a language. But what about typing on a computer keyboard?
                        Even typing out that small and basic Japanese paragraph in only hiragana and katakana took much longer than I expected.
                        There's so many tiny things that stops you dead in your tracks like:
                        How do I jump between keyboard layouts and alphabets? How do I type out びっくり instead of びつくり? 
                        How do I type out characters like <i>?, Å, Ä, and Ö</i> when on the Japanese keyboard layout? Why is every single keyboard shortcut not working?
                        Not just strictly computer related writing questions like:
                        Why is ウォ preferred over ヲ? Why has ウェcompletely erased the notion of using ヱ? Is there any difference between ぢ and じ?
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Typing basic Japanese with these questions firing in every single neuron is making me feel like a new born baby.
                        I'm now a senior citizen that types with a careful fully outstretched index finger
                        while holding an imaginary magnifying glass in the other hand. It's back to basics. All of that crusty gray brain matter
                        need to pave new paths. However don't fret Joshua, here's the deal:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No sane Japanese typer uses the <em>Ctrl&nbsp-&nbspCapslock, Shift&nbsp+&nbspCapslock and Alt&nbsp+&nbspCapslock</em> shortcuts to jump between the alphabets.
                        Everything is always typed out in hiragana. When you want a word to be in katakana just type it out fully in hiragana and then press F7.
                        Actually more often than not the IME suggestion box will just give it to you in katakana.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you start using kanji the enormous suggestion box becomes your lifesaver.
                        That's where all the kanji suggestions are and will hopefully down the line fool people on the internet that you're not in the first grade.
                        But it's not useful until you learn what the kanji means. There are plenty of sentences with the exact same hiragana that mean
                        vastly different things dependant on its kanji. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Want to mix languages like you're doing right now on this post? Well, the problem is the special characters 
                        but you can find must of them just mapped out on different keys like question mark being on the hyphen key.
                        Swedish <em>Å, Ä and Ö</em> though, tough luck, either customize your keyboard somehow or just get used to the <em>Windows&nbspkey&nbsp+&nbspSpacebar</em>
                        shortcut to jump to your Swedish layout. All this is on windows 10, using the Microsoft IME and with a Swedish keyboard mind you, from my understanding
                        these things are so fickle that it can vary dependant on whether you ate granola or oatmeal that morning. 
                        The most frequent shortcuts: <em>Ctrl&nbsp+&nbspS, Ctrl&nbsp+&nbspZ and Ctrl&nbsp+&nbspF</em> actually do work. You just need to first jump the IME
                        suggestion box first.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to type the important にゃー and double consonants you need to learn how to type small kanas. This is 
                        done by prefixing a kana with x and for double consonant you logically double tap the consonant. The aforementioned IME
                        suggestion box usually got you covered though.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An oversimplified answer to the nowadays obsolete katakana in modern Japanese like ヲ and ヱ can 
                        essentially be summed up to modern speaking patterns having rid of the existing miniscule
                        vocal difference they had. These katakana been consumed by an already existing kana.
                        There's much more to it but meaningless to dwell over at my current stage.

                    <p>
                        Looking up kanji in dictionaries it is easy to say something similar to "How are there so many meaning?" and 
                        "How am I supposed to remember this?" But have some perspective. I need to remind myself that this is not a 
                        Japanese specific thing. Spets. A common Swedish word. If I look up this simple word in a Swedish dictionary it hands 
                        me back 5 different definitions. Now someone completely ignorant to the Swedish language might just say the same 
                        sentences I said about Japanese. This is just how languages work. It's not specific to Japanese. And it is 
                        easy to forget about all the technically correct definitions words have that you use all the time.
