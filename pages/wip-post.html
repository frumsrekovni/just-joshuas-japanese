            Kanji I have encountered more than once recently:
            私, 高, 山, 登, 願, 日, 見, 本, 人, 何, 回
            遅, 達 these are like the same kanji man
            Funny Kanji:
            凸, 凹, 鬱, 忘
            Forget is deceased + mind, just brilliant.

            Endings:
            (noun)-desu     :   is / to be. e.g. ジョシュアです
            (noun)-ne       :   Seeking other's approval. (Right / Isn't it) e.g. きもちわるいTシャツですね
            (noun)-me       :   A derogatory honorific
            (verb)-tai      :   Express desire. e.g. たべたい   : Express desire for nouns ほしい　is used　e.g. ほんがほしいです. Can also be used for verbs. てつだってほしいです

            Verb Conjugations(Grouped in 3: 1:‐(w)u, ‐t(s)u, (preceded by a,u or o)-ru | 2:-ru | 3:Irregulars kuru and suru):
            (Verb)-masu     :   Past:(thing)-mashita : to do something e.g. たべます、たべました : these are the polite forms of -ru and -ta
            (Verb)-te/de    :   to make a request e.g. はなして、のんで　: Unless you want to sound like a threatening gangster the request should end with ください　if there's any sense
            of entitlement to the thing requested otherwise use おねがいします　if it's more of a favour.
            (Verb)-te + mitai: I want to e.g. ケブネカイセへいってみたいです、ケブネカイセにのぼってみたいです
            (Verb)-tai      :   Want to do the verb. e.g. ケブネカイセにいきたいです

            Particles:
            wa, ka, kara, no

            wa - topic-marker particle

            no - (noun) no (noun):   Connects nouns. e.g. てきのサノスめです

            ka - Indicates a question
            (Verb)-ka : Transforms the form to a questioning form e.g. なにをたべますか

            de - Indicates the means.
            (Object) de (Verb)-mashita : Did the verb by the means of object e.g. パソコンでプログラミングしました。

            ni - Indicates the destination / Location / time of action　(Where you are are will be in both space and time)
            (Object) ni (Verb)-masu : Verb(ing) to the object destination e.g. このでんしゃはキルナにいきますか。Sidenote, this sentence is a classic early example of realising the usefulness of kanji,
            when I read through the sentence for the first time after a few days after writing it I read "kono densha wa Kiruna nii kimasuka" Which is more or less nonsense and makes you reread it
            until you realise it is "kono densha wa Kiruna ni ikimasuka" A beginner mistake obviously, but I am a beginner, and I made this mistake. But if I would have been familiar
            with the kanji 行 which roughly means "to go" and can be read as い this mistake is essentially impossible: このでんしゃはキルナに行きますか。

            (Place) ni (Subject) : Says where the subject is e.g. 家にいる

            th sounds becomes sa in japanese. Like Thanos(サノス) and Thank you(サンキュー)

            Typing di and du for ぢ　And　づ　Is messed up

            Very common phrases from watching native Japanese speakers:
            目の前に, この感じ, こちら, 実話, 思います, あいつ, そろそろ, 今回は, これは大失敗かも、矢っ張り矢っ張、矢っ張り、全然、それば、そです、ぜひ、たくさん、中々、少し、但し

                <h2>Obsolete Kana</h2>
                <time class="date" datetime="yyyy-mm-dd">yyyy-mm-dd</time>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        Why is ウォ preferred over ヲ? Why has ウェcompletely erased the notion of using ヱ? Is there any difference between ぢ and じ?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An oversimplified answer to the nowadays obsolete katakana in modern Japanese like ヲ and ヱ can 
                        essentially be summed up to modern speaking patterns having rid of the existing miniscule
                        vocal difference they had. These katakana been consumed by an already existing kana.
                        There's much more to it but meaningless to dwell over at my current stage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Certain kana visible on the common kana charts are not in use and turned obsolete by other kanas. ヲ comes in mind. を has
                        also lost its unique sound and more or less sounds interchangeably like お.
                        Some have even fallen so out of favour that they are not even on the charts anymore. like ゐ, ヱ and ゑ. 
                        These are interesting to maybe explore further but in the grand scheme of things meaningless if your goal is to
                        communicate with modern Japanese speakers.

                        Looking up kanji in dictionaries it is easy to say something similar to "How are there so many meaning?" and 
                        "How am I supposed to remember this?" But have some perspective. I need to remind myself that this is not a 
                        Japanese specific thing. Spets. A common Swedish word. If I look up this simple word in a Swedish dictionary it hands 
                        me back 5 different definitions. Now someone completely ignorant to the Swedish language might just say the same 
                        sentences I said about Japanese. This is just how languages work. It's not specific to Japanese. And it is 
                        easy to forget about all the technically correct definitions words have that you use all the time.
